building a database with binary search trees

* delete operations are rather sketchy, if appears it doesn't have problem deleting the root of the tree but won't delete other internal nodes, wasn't able to figure this out.
*also referential integrity isn't preserved often because I got a lot of errors when trying to work this out.
